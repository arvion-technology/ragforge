## Before you open a pull request

1. `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` passes locally.
2. New behaviour has tests and (if user-facing) documentation.
3. The diff stays focused: one concern per pull request.
4. Commit messages follow Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with reproduction steps, expected vs actual behaviour, and your
